## About Me
I am currently in my senior year at Pensacola Christian College (PCC), majoring in Computer Science. Since August 2023, I've been working as a Student Software Developer in PCC's IT department, gaining hands-on experience in software development, database management, and web technologies.

My passion for technology has driven me to develop skills in several areas, including database management and software development methodologies like Agile/Scrum and DevOps. Currently, I am focusing on the database management side of my capstone project—a 'Plant Care' web application designed to help users track and care for their plants.
